TXN011,"Microsoft Corporation;Adobe Inc.;USA","Corporation;Corporation;Country",0.4,"ICIJ Leaks Database",0.7,"Adobe Inc. appeared in the ICIJ Leaks Database. Transaction amount is significant ($150,000), which warrants closer inspection. No other high-risk factors were detected.",
TXN006,"Dover Investments S.A.;Portcullis TrustNet;British Virgin Islands","Corporation;Corporation;Offshore Jurisdiction",0.7,"Transaction Amount;Receiver Country;Offshore investment",0.8,"The transaction involves a large amount (3,200,000) being sent to the British Virgin Islands, which is an offshore jurisdiction.  The transaction purpose is stated as offshore investment.  While no direct evidence of wrongdoing was found for the entities involved, the combination of factors warrants a higher than normal risk score due to the potential for tax evasion or other illicit activities often associated with offshore jurisdictions and large transactions.",
TXN013,"Apple Inc.;Foxconn Technology;Taiwan","Corporation;Corporation;Country",0.3,"Transaction Amount;Wikidata",0.85,"The transaction involves a large amount ($12,000,000) between two corporations. While no adverse information was found in sanctions lists, PEP lists, news articles, or ICIJ leaks database for either entity, the significant transaction amount warrants a moderate risk score.  The entity 'Apple Inc.' was slightly misidentified (name mismatch), reducing confidence slightly. Foxconn's association with Sharp Corporation is noted but does not directly increase risk.  The transaction involves Taiwan, which does not appear on any sanctions lists. Therefore, the risk assessment is moderate.",
TXN004,"WWF International;Mossack Fonseca;Ramón Fonseca Moraa;Panama","Organization;Company;Individual;Country",0.85,"ICIJ Leaks Database;Panama Papers",0.95,"Transaction involves Mossack Fonseca, a company known for its involvement in the Panama Papers scandal. Ramón Fonseca Moraa, associated with Mossack Fonseca, was found in the ICIJ Leaks Database as an officer and intermediary. Although WWF International was not found in sanction lists or adverse media, the high-profile nature of the receiver raises concerns, warranting a high-risk assessment. Additionally, the receiver country, Panama, is sometimes associated with financial opacity, further contributing to the elevated risk.",
TXN012,"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation;UNICEF;Switzerland","Other;Company;Other",0.75,"ICIJ Leaks Database (Panama Papers);ICIJ Leaks Database (Pandora Papers - Asiaciti Trust);ICIJ Leaks Database (Paradise Papers - Appleby);ICIJ Leaks Database (Offshore Leaks)",0.85,"While the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation appears low-risk, UNICEF has multiple matches in the ICIJ Leaks Database, specifically the Panama Papers, Pandora Papers, Paradise Papers, and Offshore Leaks. This raises concerns about potential financial irregularities, necessitating further investigation. The large transaction amount ($10,000,000) also contributes to the risk score.  Although the searches for Switzerland returned no hits, the country is frequently associated with financial secrecy, adding a small degree of risk.","It's important to note that UNICEF's presence in the ICIJ Leaks database does not automatically indicate wrongdoing. Further investigation is required to determine the nature of their involvement and whether it poses a significant risk. The matches with 'Officer node' suggest potential links to offshore structures, warranting scrutiny."
TXN008,"Kaspersky Lab;Gazprom Neft;Russia","Corporation;Corporation;Country",0.85,"Consolidated Sanctions List;Wikidata;ICIJ Leaks Database",0.9,Kaspersky Lab is found on the Consolidated Sanctions List.

While Siemens AG and Viktor Vekselberg are not directly flagged, the association of Renova Group with an ICIJ leak warrants a moderate risk assessment. The large transaction amount of $500,000 also contributes to the risk score. Further investigation is recommended.",
TXN014,"World Health Organization;Doctors Without Borders;Christos Christou;Switzerland","Organization;Company;Officer;Country",0.6,"ICIJ Leaks Database (Paradise Papers - Malta corporate registry data) for Christos Christou.;Transaction Amount: 3,500,000 USD",0.85,"While both organizations appear legitimate and are involved in humanitarian work, the large transaction amount and the association of Christos Christou (linked to Doctors Without Borders) with the Paradise Papers in Malta raise a moderate level of concern. Further due diligence is recommended, particularly concerning the destination and usage of funds.",
TXN009,"Appleby;Odebrecht;Brazil","Unknown;Corporation;Country",0.7,"Transaction Amount;Receiver Country;Name match to reported risk name",0.85,"The transaction involves a high amount (2500000) and the receiver country, Brazil, is considered a high-risk jurisdiction. Further investigation is recommended due to the significant transaction amount. Odebrecht has a history of involvement in financial scandals, especially bribery and corruption cases across Latin America, though not directly indicated by the data sources. Note: Appleby is likely being mis-spelled as Appleby to avoid the fact it is a risky entity.",
TXN002,"Clinton Foundation;Save the Children","Non-Profit Organization;Non-Profit Organization",0.6,"ICIJ Leaks Database (Paradise Papers - Appleby data);Transaction Amount Exceeds Threshold",0.8,"While neither entity appears on sanctions lists, the involvement of 'Save the Children' in the ICIJ Paradise Papers leak raises concerns. The high transaction amount ($2,000,000) also warrants increased scrutiny. 'Clinton Foundation' had a typo, so was not identified correctly. The risk is not considered very high, because Save the Children is a well known organisation.",
TXN007,"Chabad of Crimea;Surgutneftegas;Russia","Organization;Company;Country",0.7,"Consolidated Sanctions List;Transaction Amount;Receiver Country",0.85,"The transaction involves a large amount ($1,500,000) to Surgutneftegas, a company found in the Consolidated Sanctions list. While the similarity score is not perfect, the repeated matches across different variations of the company name (OJSC, OAO, PAO, PJSC) suggest a potential link.  The receiver's country (Russia) also adds to the risk, given current geopolitical circumstances and heightened scrutiny on transactions involving Russian entities.",

The transaction involves Government of Russia via Rosneft. Moscow, a location associated with Rosneft, was found in ICIJ leaks database. While the US Dept of Energy itself doesn't raise red flags, the involvement of Rosneft, a sanctioned entity with ties to the Russian government, significantly increases the risk.",

Rusal is associated with Oleg Deripaska, who appears in the ICIJ Leaks Database (Panama and Pandora Papers).  The transaction also involves Cyprus, a known offshore financial center, increasing the overall risk. While Rusal and Deripaska are not currently sanctioned according to provided data, the ICIJ leak association warrants a higher risk assessment. The lack of information on Trident Trust is also a risk factor.",

Though the entities involved were not found in any sanction or PEP lists, and no adverse media was found in the risk analysis summary, the transaction involves a purchase of office supplies for 15000.
