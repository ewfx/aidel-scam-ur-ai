While Trident Trust has no negative hits, Rusal has a moderate risk due to news articles suggesting potential exploitation of resources in occupied territories and association with Oleg Deripaska found in the ICIJ leaks. Igor Sechin's involvement as the approver adds to the risk because of his close ties to leadership, even though he is not directly sanctioned or listed as a PEP. The nature of the commodity trade is also a factor as it could be used to obfuscate illicit activities."
TXN-2023-13P9Q,"National Science Foundation;Stanford University;USA;Hoover Institution","Government Organization;University;Country;Think Tank",0.3,"ICIJ Leaks Database (Hoover Institution);Transaction Amount",0.75,"While the National Science Foundation and Stanford University themselves appear to be low-risk entities based on available data, the transaction amount is significant ($2.5 million). Additionally, the Hoover Institution, associated with Stanford University, was found in the ICIJ Leaks database. While the exact nature of the connection and its implications are unclear without further investigation, this warrants a moderate risk score. The risk score is increased due to the large transaction amount."
TXN-2023-5A9B,"Nordic Union Ltd;Al-Barakaat;Teodoro Nguema","Company;Financial Institution;Politically Exposed Person",0.85,"VPN Usage Detected;Al-Barakaat Bank listed on Consolidated Sanctions list;Teodoro Nguema identified as PEP",0.8,"Transaction involves a sanctioned entity (Al-Barakaat Bank) and a Politically Exposed Person (Teodoro Nguema), along with VPN usage and the absence of information about Nordic Union Ltd, raising concerns about potential illicit activities. The Al-Barakaat entity matched with Al-Barakaat Bank on a consolidated sanctions list, which is a strong indicator of risk. Furthermore, the approver of the transaction, Teodoro Nguema, is identified as a PEP, which warrants additional scrutiny. The use of VPN adds to the suspicions surrounding the transaction."

News articles related to both entities and associated countries do not indicate significant financial misdoings. The slight risk assigned primarily stems from a small possibility of financial misconduct found in news articles related to entities in Germany, coupled with the substantial transaction amount which warrants closer scrutiny despite the clean records."
TXN-2023-8E4F,"Mossack Fonseca;Commerzbank;HSBC Private Bank Suisse","Law Firm;Bank;Private Bank",0.85,"Panama Papers (Implied through entity name);ICIJ Leaks Database",0.9,"The transaction involves Mossack Fonseca, a law firm heavily implicated in the Panama Papers scandal, suggesting a high risk of illicit financial activities. While Commerzbank shows no direct evidence of financial wrongdoings in the provided data, the involvement of HSBC Private Bank Suisse, which appears in the ICIJ leaks database, further elevates the risk. The large transaction amount ($4,750,000) also warrants a high-risk score."

Viktor Petrov has a possible match in the ICIJ Leaks Database (Igor Petrov). Gazprom Neft and related entities are present on sanctions lists. Gazprom Neft has news articles referencing sanctions and sanctions waivers which indicates slightly elevated risk. Russia is also on the consolidated sanctions list.

Although BTC-e was not found on sanctions or PEP lists, the news articles raise significant concerns. The transaction involves a known bank, Wells Fargo, which has had minor past issues, and the transaction occurs within the USA, which, by itself, does not pose a high risk.",

Although the sender Al-Barakaat was not found in sanction lists or ICIJ leaks, the transaction amount ($500,000) is significant and warrants caution.

The transaction amount ($1,800,000) is significant, warranting closer scrutiny despite the low individual risk scores. The slightly elevated risk scores are mainly due to weak signals related to the countries involved.",Further investigation is recommended to confirm the legitimacy of the research collaboration and ensure that the funds are used for the stated purpose. Enhanced due diligence should be performed on all entities involved. Continuous monitoring of news and sanction lists is recommended.
TXN-2023-17W3X,"Clinton Foundation;Red Cross","Foundation;Organization",0.2,"Transaction Amount;Risk Analysis Summary",0.8,"The transaction involves a relatively large amount ($500,000). While initial searches for 'linton Foundation' and 'Red Cros' (typos in the provided Risk Analysis Summary) returned no adverse findings in sanctions lists, PEP lists, news articles, or ICIJ leaks, the size of the transaction warrants a moderate risk score. The entities were not found in the sanction lists, PEP lists, and ICIJ leaks database, however there were typos in the entity names during the search, resulting in incomplete information. Further investigation with the correctly spelled entity names is recommended.",

While HSBC Private Bank Suisse itself does not appear on sanction lists, Switzerland has appeared in the ICIJ leaks database (Paradise Papers). Though the receiving entity isn't explicitly sanctioned based on the provided data, transactions involving Iranian entities require heightened due diligence. The combination of the amount, the receiver's location, and Switzerland's appearance in the Paradise Papers contributes to the elevated risk score.",
TXN-2023-19A5B,"Iskander Makhmudov;Harvard University","Individual;Educational Institution",0.3,"",0.7,"While the transaction involves a substantial amount ($100,000), initial checks against sanctions lists, PEP lists, news articles, and ICIJ leaks database for both Iskander Makhmudov and Harvard University yielded no adverse findings.  The lack of Wikidata information for Iskander Makhmudov is slightly concerning, hence a low risk score is assigned, and further investigation is recommended before approving the transaction. It's crucial to verify the legitimacy of the source of funds despite the stated purpose of 'Endowment fund donation'. A higher risk score would be warranted if Iskander Makhmudov was a Politically Exposed Person or if adverse media hits were found.",
TXN-2023-20C6D,"Odebrecht;Commerzbank;Brazil;Germany","Corporation;Bank;Country;Country",0.6,"News Articles Search;Amount of transaction",0.85,"While Odebrecht, Commerzbank, Brazil and Germany do not appear on sanctions or PEP lists directly, and were not found in ICIJ leaks, the large transaction amount ($4,200,000) from Odebrecht, a company with a history of involvement in significant corruption scandals in Brazil and other countries, raises concerns. Commerzbank is a major international bank and no specific adverse information was found during the search. However, due to the history of Odebrecht, a moderately high risk score is assigned, reflecting the potential for money laundering or other illicit financial activity, even if not directly evident from the provided data. Germany had a low score in news articles, but the country is known for being a financial hub, so there is a possibility of financial misdoings. The final risk score is also influenced by the large amount of the transaction.",

Additionally, the involvement of Afriland First Bank as an intermediary adds a layer of complexity that requires assessment, even though initial searches did not flag any immediate concerns.
