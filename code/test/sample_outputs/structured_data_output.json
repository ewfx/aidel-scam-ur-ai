The entity 'Apple Inc.' was slightly misidentified (name mismatch), reducing confidence slightly. Foxconn's association with Sharp Corporation is noted but does not directly increase risk.  The transaction involves Taiwan, which does not appear on any sanctions lists. Therefore, the risk assessment is moderate."
