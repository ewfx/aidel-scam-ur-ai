While Trident Trust has no negative hits, Rusal has a moderate risk due to news articles suggesting potential exploitation of resources in occupied territories and association with Oleg Deripaska found in the ICIJ leaks. Igor Sechin's involvement as the approver adds to the risk because of his close ties to leadership, even though he is not directly sanctioned or listed as a PEP. The nature of the commodity trade is also a factor as it could be used to obfuscate illicit activities."
