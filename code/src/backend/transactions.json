These factors, combined with the Cayman Islands jurisdiction of the receiver's bank, elevate the risk.  While 'Rosneft Oil Company' shows high similarity scores to sanctioned entities, final determination of risk requires precise matching to exact legal names on the sanctions lists. Also, the news articles for LLP and Cayman National Bank has some negative sentiment, but the news is not directly linked to this transaction, and the sender used a VPN exit node in Panama, which is a high-risk jurisdiction."
